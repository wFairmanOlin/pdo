    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall objective is to maximize performance (final velocity) and minimize cost of the first stage of a rocket.\n",
    "- Final Velocity will be determined from a 2D simulation of a rocket traveling through the atmosphere.\n",
    "- Cost will be based off of historical data relating thrust at sea level to cost of engines and data relating the dry mass of rockets to cost of manufacturing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Design variables will include:\n",
    "    - area ratio (ratio between the cross sectional area of the throat and the cross sectional area of the nozzle).\n",
    "    - propellent mass flow (amount of propellent flowing through the engine)\n",
    "    - *dry mass (mass of rocket minus the fuel and payload)*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Rocket companies are constantly trying to squeeze performance out of their designs due to high costs associated with launching payloads into orbit.\n",
    "- Stakeholders:\n",
    "    - private launch companies\n",
    "    - governments\n",
    "- needs:\n",
    "    - lower costs to increase profits\n",
    "    - higher performing designs to expand launch capabilities\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic multi-objective optimization problem is:\n",
    "- minimize cost, maximize final velocity\n",
    "- wrt: area ratio, propellent mass flow, dry mass\n",
    "- constraints: none (this might change depending on the initial results of the simulation)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation\n",
    "There are hundreds of variables that go into determing the final velocity of a first stage booster. I am making the following variables constant to simplify the simulation: \n",
    "- phsyical shape of the rocket (diameter, length, nosecone)\n",
    "- mass of payload and second stage\n",
    "- fuel mass and type (assuming homogenous fuel with constant flow rate)\n",
    "- thrust profile\n",
    "- gravity\n",
    "\n",
    "The follwing free body shows the forces I am considering:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/free_body_diagram.jpg\" alt=\"free body diagram\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "I am assuming the rocket will be a point mass so that a changing thrust vector will not produce torque. I am also assuming that the drag force will always be anti-parallel to the direction of the velocity. \n",
    "\n",
    "There will be several equations to determine the drag force and thrust. I have not finalized these equations, but I have included some of the examples I am currently working with:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/drag.png\" alt=\"drag\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/thrust.png\" alt=\"thrust\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost will be determined by a mix of historical data and external models. I have found a few examples in my research but have not finalized what equations/data I will use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there will be a tradeoff between reducing the complexity and getting more realistic/interesting results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "I am currently aiming towards using monte carlo simulations to generate a series of results. There should be a distinct pareto frontier I can analyze to draw conclusions from the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results / Conclusion\n",
    "I am hoping to have several designs that fall along the pareto frontier that I can analyze in further detail and relate to historical launch vehicles\n",
    "- There will likely be unrealistic trends in my data due to some of the simplifications I made in my simulation. \n",
